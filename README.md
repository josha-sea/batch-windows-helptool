# Batch Help-Tool for Windows

## Motivation
I always forget the CMD-commands, so I hardcoded them in a batch-script.

## Description
A batch script with native-windows commands including:
- SFC/SCANNOW
- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
- NETSTAT -bof
- CHKDSK
- CHKDSK /R
- Download Virus (try it)

## Installation / Compiling
Download or clone the git repo:
<pre> <code> git clone https://github.com/josha-sea/windows-helptool.git </code> </pre>

## Usage
After downloading or cloning the git repo, run the batch script.
NOTE: Must be executed as administrator -> Richt click on batch script and click "Run as Administrator"
